# STARSHIP
A game implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm to fulfill Quiz 2 of Design &amp; Analysis Algorithm class.

## Introduction
Hello, friends! We made this game as a project for our lesson in Design &amp; Analysis Algorithm.

## How to run the game
Unfortunately, we have not yet made the installer for this game. Thus, to access the game, what need to be done is :
- clone this repository to Unity
- run the game from the editor
- or even better, use `File -> Build And Run` setting to make an executable game

Enjoy!
